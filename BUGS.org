* TODO Scrolling small amounts gets “stuck” on ^Ls.
  Scrolling with the mouse wheel with only three lines per event gets
  stuck, especially near the bottom of the file. This seems to be
  because the scrolling jumps up three visual lines, but only one
  logical line, then back down one logical line during recentering
  during redisplay.

  This may drive me to use overlays rather than display tables, in
  which case the extra space would be handled via a ~line-height~
  property rather than newlines, since text replacement overlays get
  all wonky in a different way when spanning multiple lines.
